      <h3>Back-end Software Engineer</h3>
      <p>
        I actively contributed to the development of RESTful APIs using Perl,
        engaging in both front-end and back-end work for an in-house admin tool.
        With SQLPro, I gathered data and created custom reports, showcasing my
        hands-on experience. I honed my skills with Git and Linux shell for
        version control, ensuring smooth collaboration. These experiences

        practical understanding of key tools in software development.
